.Description of the project
This project uses two Pull Up buttons to control an LED. We will make the LED slowly inline by +5 to reach
255 when we press Button A. Then when we press Button B the LED will slowly decline by +5 to reach 0. We
will include a Active buzzer into this project. When we reach 255 and the user is still pressing the 
button A down. We will make the buzzer buzz. Same as when the user presses the button B and keeps pressing
when the LED is at 0 (Off). This is a simple little project.

.Items Needed
* Two Push buttons
* One 330 Ohm Resistor
* One Red LED
* One Active Buzzer
* One Arduino R3 
* One Breadboard
* Nine jumper wires

.Circuit Design
On the breadboard I installed the one push button left legs at column bottom 55 on the second part
of the breadboard, rows F, G, H, I, and J. The right legs in column bottom 53. The second push button
left legs in column bottom 45 and the right legs into column bottom 43. I installed the 330 Ohm 
left leg into column 30 on the rows A, B, C, D, and E. The right leg into column 35. I installed the 
anode (long leg) of the LED into column 35 and the cathode (short leg) into column 36. Then I 
installed the active buzzer positive leg into column 40 and the right leg into column 43. I ran the 
GND jumper from the Arduino to the GND rail on the breadboard. Jumper from Pin 2 to column bottom 55. 
Jumper from Pin 4 to column 40. Jumper from Pin 5 to column bottom 45. Jumper from Pin 9 to column 30. 
Jumper from GND rail to column bottom 53. Jumper from GND rail to column bottom 43. Jumper from 
GND rail to column 36. Jumper from GND rail to column 43. The circuit is now wired up.

.Code
The code for this project is in the file called "DimmerOnOffSwitch.ino".

.What To Expect
This project will take the button readings to see which button is being pressed. Then it will increase
the LEDVal by +-5. The adjust the LED according to the LEDVal after the +-5. When the button is held 
down and the LED hits the max either full bright or off, the active buzzer will tone to let the user 
that the max has be reached. Fun simple circuit that teaches you some good logic skills to figure out
the LEDVal and how to use that to make the LED change.
